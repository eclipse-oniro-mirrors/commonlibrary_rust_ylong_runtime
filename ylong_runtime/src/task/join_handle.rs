//! Joinhandle for asynchronous tasks.

//! [`JoinHandle`] is similar to a JoinHandle for a thread. It could be used to
//! await an asynchronous task to finish to get its result.

/// This can be considered as the equivalent of [`std::thread::JoinHandle`]
/// for a ylong task rather than a thread.
///
/// It could be used to join the corresponding task or cancel it.
/// If a `JoinHandle` is dropped, then the task continues executing in the
/// background and its return value is lost. There is no way to join the task
/// after its JoinHandle is dropped.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// let handle = ylong_runtime::spawn(async {
///     let handle2 = ylong_runtime::spawn(async { 1 });
///     assert_eq!(handle2.await.unwrap(), 1);
/// });
/// ylong_runtime::block_on(handle).unwrap();
/// ```
