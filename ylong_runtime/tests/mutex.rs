//! Now `sdv_mutex` only has one test. In this test, `sleep` is called,
//! requiring to initialize time driver by `driver::Driver::get_mut_driver()`.
//! This initialization will only be called in `RuntimeBuilder::build()` when
//! `net` feature is open. Therefore, temporarily mark the whole test file so
//! that it will only run when these features are open. If more tests are added
//! in the future, this conditionally compiling macro should be moved to
//! mark the test `sdv_mutex_lock_hold_longtime`.

/// SDV test cases for Mutex::lock() interface
///
/// # Brief
/// 1. Create a Concurrent Mutual Exclusion Lock.
/// 2. Make a concurrent process obtain a concurrent mutex lock and sleep after
///    obtaining it to hold the lock for a long time.
/// 3. The main thread creates a new concurrent thread to perform the locking
///    operation, and then modifies the value in the lock after obtaining the
///    lock.
/// 4. Check the value in the lock.
